## 📌 Overview

**Project Daikoku** is a C#-based framework for building, simulating, and analyzing malware components in a safe and modular way. Inspired by real-world malware and red team tooling, it's designed to educate and empower security researchers through hands-on experience with malware techniques.

> ⚠️ **This project is for educational and research purposes only. Do not use on any network or system you do not own or have explicit permission to test.**

## 🧱 Architecture

The framework is built around clean, extensible interfaces and modules:

```
ProjectDaikoku/
├── Interfaces/       # Core abstractions (ICommand, IModule, etc.)
├── Core/             # Command router, loader, main loop
├── Modules/          # Individual functionality (ReverseShell, Keylogger, etc.)
├── Common/           # Utilities, crypto, config
├── Docs/             # Thesis notes, design documentation
├── Scripts/          # Listeners, analysis tools
└── Daikoku.sln       # Visual Studio solution
```

## ⚙️ Features

| Module            | Description                                   | Status          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 🔁 ReverseShell   | TCP-based reverse shell for command execution | ✅ Complete     |
| 🖥️ Keylogger      | Simulated keylogger (for research only)       | 🔄 In Dev       |
| 🧠 Persistence    | Adds registry startup keys                    | 🔄 In Dev       |
| 🌐 HTTP C2        | Polling C2 via HTTP requests                  | 🧪 Experimental |
| 🎭 Obfuscation    | Base64 + simple XOR for evasion               | 🔄 In Dev       |
| 🧪 SandboxEvasion | Detects sandbox/debugger environments         | 🔄 Planned      |

## 🧠 Goals

- ✅ Learn core malware development techniques in a safe lab
- ✅ Understand how persistence, evasion, and communication work
- ✅ Reverse engineer your own modules for practice
- ✅ Generate thesis material from real code and experiments

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Requirements

- Windows 10 (VM recommended)
- .NET SDK 6.0+
- Visual Studio or `dotnet` CLI

### 🖥️ Build & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youruser/project-daikoku.git
cd project-daikoku
dotnet build
```

> Run only inside isolated VMs. Never test on a live machine.

## 🎓 For Thesis Use

The project includes:

- 📝 Module design notes
- 📊 Behavior logs (sandbox output, screenshots)
- 📖 Documented case studies for each module
- 📁 Safe test samples and simulation logic

Perfect for building your thesis on malware architecture, detection, and analysis.
